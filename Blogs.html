	<h3>Let's explore interesting things about cats.</h3>
	<p>Cats have some fascinating and quirky traits that make them stand out as pets. One particularly interesting behavior is called "kneading." You've probably seen a cat rhythmically pushing its paws against a soft surface like a blanket, your lap, or even another cat. This behavior harks back to kittenhood when they would knead their mother's belly to stimulate milk flow. Even though adult cats don't need to knead for milk, they continue doing it throughout their lives as a sign of comfort, affection, and contentment. Some cats even purr while kneading, making it a heartwarming display of trust and relaxation.Another curious fact about cats is their ability to land on their feet from great heights, a skill known as the "righting reflex." Cats have an incredibly flexible spine and a unique inner ear structure that helps them detect which way is up. This reflex allows them to twist their bodies in midair and land safely on their feet, minimizing injury. However, it's still wise not to put this ability to the test with dangerous falls!</p>
